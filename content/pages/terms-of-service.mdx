## Introduction

These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and VoiceClone ("Company," "we," "our," or "us") governing your use of our website, software, and services (collectively, the "Services").


By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services.

## Merchant of Record & Billing Partner

We use **Creem** as our Merchant of Record (MoR). When you purchase a subscription or any paid feature, you are contracting with Creem for the transaction. Creem handles payment processing, sales tax calculation and remittance, refunds, and chargeback management on our behalf. Invoices and receipts will be issued by Creem, and applicable taxes will be shown at checkout.

For billing-related self-service (e.g., viewing orders, updating payment methods, canceling subscriptions, requesting invoices or support), you can use Creem’s Customer Portal provided after a successful payment.

## Acceptance of Terms
