        "q": "How much echo can it reduce?",

      {
        "q": "Will it improve very noisy recordings?",
        "a": "It helps, but extremely low signal‑to‑noise sources are challenging. Capture the best possible audio at the source when you can."

      {
        "q": "Is the output podcast‑ready for loudness?",

      {
        "q": "Can I use it for music?",
        "a": "It’s optimized for speech; light cleanup on music may work, but detailed music restoration is better done in a DAW."

      {
        "q": "What if the result breathes or pumps?",
        "a": "This can happen when background noise is very dynamic. Try trimming to the spoken sections, or record more consistent room tone."

      {
        "q": "Will it fix clipping distortion?",
        "a": "Severe clipping cannot be fully repaired. Reduce input gain during recording and keep peaks below 0 dBFS."
