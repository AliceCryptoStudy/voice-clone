      {
        "q": "Will this audio enhancer free tool make my voice sound metallic?",
        "a": "Our AI voice enhancer balances noise reduction with intelligibility to keep your voice natural. This professional audio enhancer avoids metallic artifacts—for extreme noise, try lighter cleanup or re‑recording."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can this voice enhancer online remove 50/60Hz electrical hum?",
        "a": "Yes, our audio enhancer free tool effectively reduces typical hum and low‑frequency rumble using advanced AI voice enhancer algorithms."
      },
      {
        "q": "How much echo can this audio enhancer AI reduce?",
        "a": "Our voice enhancer can improve moderate room echo significantly; very strong reverb may require re‑recording or additional tools beyond this audio enhancer free solution."
      },
      {
        "q": "Will it improve very noisy recordings?",
        "a": "It helps, but extremely low signal‑to‑noise sources are challenging. Capture the best possible audio at the source when you can."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is the output podcast‑ready for loudness?",
        "a": "Results are leveled for comfortable listening. For strict platform specs, double‑check LUFS before publishing."
      },
      {
        "q": "What file formats and sizes are supported?",
        "a": "MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG; up to 50MB per file."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do you store my audio?",
        "a": "Processing is temporary and purpose‑only; audio is not used to train models."
      },
      {
        "q": "How long does processing take?",
        "a": "Most files enhance in seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on length and network conditions."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I adjust enhancement strength?",
        "a": "The default setting avoids over‑processing. For advanced control, consider a DAW workflow."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I use it for music?",
        "a": "It’s optimized for speech; light cleanup on music may work, but detailed music restoration is better done in a DAW."
      },
      {
        "q": "What if the result breathes or pumps?",
        "a": "This can happen when background noise is very dynamic. Try trimming to the spoken sections, or record more consistent room tone."
      },
      {
        "q": "Will it fix clipping distortion?",
        "a": "Severe clipping cannot be fully repaired. Reduce input gain during recording and keep peaks below 0 dBFS."
