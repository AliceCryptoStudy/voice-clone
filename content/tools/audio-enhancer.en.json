    "items": [
      {"q": "Will denoising make my voice sound metallic?", "a": "We balance noise reduction with intelligibility to keep your voice natural. Extreme noise may still cause artifacts—lighter cleanup or re‑recording can help."},
      {"q": "Can it remove 50/60Hz electrical hum?", "a": "Yes, typical hum and low‑frequency rumble can be reduced effectively."},
      {"q": "How much echo can it reduce?", "a": "Moderate room echo can be improved; very strong reverb may require re‑recording or advanced tools."},
      {"q": "Will it improve very noisy recordings?", "a": "It helps, but extremely low signal‑to‑noise sources are challenging. Capture the best possible audio at the source when you can."},
      {"q": "Is the output podcast‑ready for loudness?", "a": "Results are leveled for comfortable listening. For strict platform specs, double‑check LUFS before publishing."},
      {"q": "What file formats and sizes are supported?", "a": "MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG; up to 50MB per file."},
      {"q": "Do you store my audio?", "a": "Processing is temporary and purpose‑only; audio is not used to train models."},
      {"q": "How long does processing take?", "a": "Most files enhance in seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on length and network conditions."},
      {"q": "Can I adjust enhancement strength?", "a": "The default setting avoids over‑processing. For advanced control, consider a DAW workflow."},
      {"q": "Can I use it for music?", "a": "It’s optimized for speech; light cleanup on music may work, but detailed music restoration is better done in a DAW."}
